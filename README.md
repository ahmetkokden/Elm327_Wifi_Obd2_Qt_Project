# Elm327 Obd2 Console
The ELM327 is a programmed microcontroller produced by ELM Electronics for translating the on-board diagnostics (OBD) interface found in most modern cars. The ELM327 command protocol is one of the most popular PC-to-OBD interface standards and is also implemented by other vendors.

The original ELM327 is implemented on the PIC18F2480 microcontroller from Microchip Technology.

ELM327 is one of a family of OBD translators from ELM Electronics. Other variants implement only a subset of the OBD protocols.
