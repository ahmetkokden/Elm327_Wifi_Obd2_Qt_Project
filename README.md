# Elm327 Obd2 Console
<b>The ELM327</b> is a programmed microcontroller produced by ELM Electronics for translating the on-board diagnostics (OBD) interface found in most modern cars. The ELM327 command protocol is one of the most popular PC-to-OBD interface standards and is also implemented by other vendors.</br>

The original ELM327 is implemented on the PIC18F2480 microcontroller from Microchip Technology.</br>

ELM327 is one of a family of OBD translators from ELM Electronics. Other variants implement only a subset of the OBD protocols.</br>
